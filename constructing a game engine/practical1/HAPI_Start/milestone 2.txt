New Functionality
-----------------
texture loading and drawing
texture error if not loaded and horrid pink for debbuging

Code Additions
--------------
texture alpha drawing
function to turn texture to horrid pink and error message saying what texture file is missing

Tests
-----
moving off screen, doesnt come up with error and increases frame rate by a moderate amount, fps 500-550 while on screen, 550-600 while off screen
try to load a texture of a file that doesnt exist, error comes up and says which file is missing and displays a horrid pink texture
average fps 490-600
second texture can move 8 directions
second texture is drawn over the first using alpha
no errors or warnings


Notes
-----
need to further optimise functions as it can be sluggish especially drawing by pixel
